## Features

## Development

The development of this project followed modern software development practices and utilized the following technologies:

- MVVM Design Pattern: The project was structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, separating concerns and promoting maintainable and scalable code.
- Node.js with MongoDB (Mongoose): The backend was implemented using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, along with MongoDB as the database management system.
- Firebase Firestore: To achieve real-time data updates and synchronization, Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database, was integrated into the project.

These technologies were carefully chosen to ensure efficient development, robust data management, and seamless real-time updates.
