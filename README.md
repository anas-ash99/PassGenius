# PassGenius

P.S Please feel free to explore other newer projects on my profile, as this app is slightly older and may not adhere strictly to the clean architecture principles.

PassGenius is an Android mobile application that allows users to store and manage their passwords, payment information, notes, and more. The app is currently under development and lacks some features, especially security measures. Therefore, it is advised not to store any real sensitive information. PssGenius is intended for testing purposes only.

## Features

- Securely store and manage passwords, payment information, notes, and more.
- Intuitive user interface for efficient organization and access to information.



## Development

The development of this project followed modern software development practices and incorporated the following technologies and design patterns:

- MVVM Design Pattern: The project was structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. This pattern ensures separation of concerns, facilitates code reusability, and promotes a clear and maintainable architecture.

- Node.js with MongoDB: The backend of the application was developed using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, in conjunction with MongoDB as the database management system. This combination offers a scalable and efficient solution for handling server-side operations and data storage.

- Room Databases: To provide offline support and data persistence, Room Databases, an Android library, was integrated into the project. This enables users to access and modify data locally when they have no internet access, ensuring a seamless user experience.

These technologies and design patterns were carefully chosen to create a robust and user-friendly application, accommodating both online and offline usage scenarios.



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

Alternatively you can just download the APK file on your Android phone using the following link:

I still haven't implemented any UI for creating a new account so you can just sign in using yout biometric authentication or just enter any password



## Disclaimer

The developers of PssGenius do not assume any liability for any loss or damage caused by the use of this application. It is strongly recommended not to store any real sensitive information within the app due to its current development stage and lack of necessary security features.
